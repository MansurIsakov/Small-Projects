This project was created to practice working with arrays, numbers, dates, Intl, and timer under the course of Jonas Schmedtmann. The project displays a web app of bank where the user can loan, transfer, and sort money. Also timer and closing an account functions are ON!

To taste it out use these accounts:
  
 1. User - js PIN - 1111
 2. User - mi PIN - 4444
